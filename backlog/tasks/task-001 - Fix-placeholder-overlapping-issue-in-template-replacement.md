## Description

Currently, placeholders with similar names like "_place_holder_" and "_placeholder_1_" are causing conflicts during template replacement. Both placeholders get replaced by the first run of information, leading to incorrect data substitution. This issue occurs because the current matching logic doesn't properly distinguish between similar placeholder names.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Regex validation correctly matches the complete structure inside underscores
- [ ] #2 Placeholders with similar names (e.g., _place_holder_ and _placeholder_1_) are replaced independently
- [ ] #3 Each placeholder receives its correct corresponding value during replacement
- [ ] #4 No overlap or interference between similar placeholder names
- [ ] #5 Existing placeholder functionality remains intact for non-overlapping cases
<!-- AC:END -->
